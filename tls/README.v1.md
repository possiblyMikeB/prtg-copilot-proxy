# Create client & server certificates with CFSSL

This directory contains the bare essentials required to create a one-off `CA` and use it to 
create a sufficiently secure client/server certificate pair. 


## Make the `CA`: 
Fundamentally, we don't care about the `CA`; the only relavent piece of information we are
going to eventually keep is it's public certificate. However, we'll need it in tact long enough 
for us to issuse what we're really after. 

Using the `CSR` parameters from `csr/ca.json` (feel free to modify) we generate the `CA` by running,

```bash
$ cfssl gencert -initca "csr/ca.json" > obj.json
$ cfssl -bare -f obj.json "ca"
```

Once run, you will find `ca.pem`, `ca-key.pem`, and `ca.csr` in the directory you 
ran the commands from; they are (in order) you `CA`'s public certificate, private key, and 
originating `CSR`.

## Issue the `server` certificate:

To generate the `server` certificate, we should modify the `hosts` & `CN` fields from `csr/server.json` 
so that they accurately refect the deployment environment. Alternatively, we can pass `cfssl gencert` the `-hostname` 
argment; this argumnet expects a comma seperated list of ip-addresses and hostnames to be added to the resulting certificate as `SAN` entries. 

In this case, running the following,

```bash
$ cfssl gencert -config "cfssl.json" -ca "ca.pem" -ca-key "ca-key.json" -hostname "localhost,127.0.0.1,metrics.davidson.edu" -profile "server" "csr/server.json" > obj.json 
$ cfssl -bare -f obj.json "cert"
```

will produce similar files as before, only this time prefixed with `cert` instead of `ca`; in addition 
looking at the output from `openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout` we should something similar to:

```

where the fields "X509v3 Subject Alternative Name" and "X509v3 Extended Key Usage" contain (respectively) the hostnames we passed to `cfssl` and contain the appropriate role we expect to use the certificate for (i.e. `TLS Web Server Authentication` in this case).


## Issue one (or more) `client` certificate:

The `CN` is the only field really useful (aside from the private key) when creating the kind of "only works as a client send" certificates we will generate; looking at `csr/client.json`, you can see we only used the `CN` to vaguely label the context in which that certificate should have originated from.

```json
{
    "CN": "PRTG-Service",
    "hosts": [],
    "key": {
        "algo": "ecdsa",
        "size": 256
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "US"
        }
    ]
}
```

Finding that it fits with what we want, let's create the client certificates. Making the assumption that the forgoing instruction for the `CA` and `server` certificate have been done on `metrics-host`, we will do the following 


 1. Run `openssl rand -hex 16` and use the output to replace the `key` field under `client_key` in the files `cfssl.json` & `remote.json`.
 2. Copy `remote.json` and `csr/client.json` to `PRTG`, or where ever are going to upload the client certificates from.
 3. Once done, begin the `cfssl` remote signing service on `metrics-host` as follows:

```
$ cfssl serve -config "cfssl.json" -ca "ca.pem" -ca-key "ca-key.pem" -port 8889 -address metrics-host
```
 4. From where your copies of `remote.json` & `client.json` reside run the following,
```
$ cfssl genkey client.json | cfssljson -bare client
$ cfssl sign  -config "remote.json" -profile=client "client.csr" | cfssljson -bare client
```
 5. Stop the `cfssl` remote signing server on `metrics-host`


You should now have `client.pem`, `client-key.pem`, and `client.csr`.
